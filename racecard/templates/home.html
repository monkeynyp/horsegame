        are the best ways to make decisions and forecasts. Thatâ€™s why it created
        this website and to do different kind of Machine Learning Prediction and
        verify the accracy. One of the data set I got is the horse racing data
        from Hong Kong. Although many people say that horse racing is
        unpredictable and random, I would like to get start with this data and
        see what kind of accuracy can be achieved by applying machine learning.'
